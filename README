==========

DEPENDENCIES
------------
- jquery >= 1.4.2
- jquery.ui >= 1.8.0
- jquery.slidescale.js
- jquery.slidescale.css


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Scalable gallery image viewer, has the ability to take images already on page,
a list of urls passed in, or both to construct a gallery. Uses incremental
preloading to preload images to save bandwidth.

A user can define how many pictures to be preloaded (preload_num) past the
current image. This is configurable for both main photos and for thumbnails.

Tested in IE7+, FF3.6, Chrome.

If you're using the plugin, _send me an email_! It would be great to
know if people actually use it and where.


Events

SlideScale triggers and listens to some events that may be useful for
developers.

next::
